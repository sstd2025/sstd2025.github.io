								<h3>Keynote 2 &ndash; Mapping Cultural Values Across Regions for AI Alignment</h3>
								<p align="justify">
										<span style="font-weight: bold;">Speaker: </span>  Xing Xie (Microsoft Research Asia)
									</p>
									<p align="justify">
										<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</span> 
										 As large language models become deeply integrated into societies worldwide, ensuring that their behaviors align with diverse human values has emerged as a critical challenge. Cultural values often vary significantly across geographic regions, reflecting local histories, traditions, and social norms. In this talk, I will share our interdisciplinary research on identifying and evaluating these regional cultural differences, and how we assess AI systemsâ€™ ability to respect and adapt to them. By collaborating with social science researchers, we aim to advance culturally aware and globally responsible AI. I hope this talk will inspire dialogue on the role of regional cultural diversity in shaping the future of AI systems.
